The output data.frame also has attributes with information about the status:
download.time, parse.time, download.status, parse.status
These attributes can be used for troubleshooting WaterOneFlow/WaterML server errors.
If parse status is "NO_SERIES_FOUND", then this site doesn't have any available data.
